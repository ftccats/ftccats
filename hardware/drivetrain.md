## Drive Train 

The Drive Train is one of the most important parts of the robot, Consists motors, chains, gears etc that make up the many mechanisms of your robot. The Drive Train's purpose is to transport or move the robot in any way however, Drive Trains may vary. Here are some of the most common Drive Trains: Chain Drive, Gear Drive, and direct attachment.

## Direct Attachment

Direct attachment is arguably the most simple meathod, no extra nonsense is needed to attach wheels directly to an axel. It is also probably the most widely used method

## Gear Drive

Gear Drive, is the cross between Direct Attachment and Chain Drive, It's more reliable then direct attachment but less reliable then chain drive. Gear Drive is easier to attach then Chain Drive but harder to attach then Direct Attachment. It can hold more weight and stress then Directly attaching wheels but it is more fragile then using Chain Drive. (This drive chain is arguably the most uncommen method)



## Chain Drive

The Chain Drive made to alleviate strain/stress on the axels supporting the robot. Chain is also good for more heavy weight robots because it is able to handle more stress than directly attaching things and wheels. This method may be harder for beginning teams because using chains may be harder utilize effectly.
