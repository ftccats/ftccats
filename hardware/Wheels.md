## Intro to Wheels
Although other methods exist, wheels are by far the most common method of movement for robots.
## Wheel Summaries
## Standard Wheels
Wheels coming from in Tetrix or Actobotics sets with standard directional movement. 
## Omni Wheels
Wheels with small discs perpendicular to turning direction. They allow you to turn more easily, especially with a two wheel drive.
## Mecanum Wheels
Mecanum wheels are very similar to Omni wheels excpet they have discs which are slanted to fit for any direction if assembled right. This wheel is one of the most popular wheels for it's ability to make robots "Strafe" or move side to side without turning the robot.
## Other Wheels
There are many other options for wheels. However the ones listed above are the most popular.
## Specifics
## Omni Wheels
Omni wheels have a rather niche role of allowing robots using standard wheels to turn easier. Robots using standard wheels will generally have two omni wheels in the front to make it turn with less friction (because most robots turn by having two pairs of wheels move in opposite directions to eachother, the wheels will have to drag along the ground).
## Mecanum Wheels
Almost all high level teams will use these. They greatly increase movement options but also are more difficult to handle. More information can be found [here] (https://ftccats.github.io/software/ProgrammingMecanumWheels)
## Other wheels
Other examples of wheels is the flywheels. These are used to quickly launch a projectile by running the wheels at a high speed and putting the projectile between the wheels. These are usually only used in very specific contexts such 2016's Velocity Vortex challenge.
