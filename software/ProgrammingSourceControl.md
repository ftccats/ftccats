## General Info
  Source control has two main functions: firstly, it allows multiple people to work on the same project. Secondly, it allows for you to manage changes by letting you view and revert changes. Most teams use github to do source control and this tutorial will focus on github, but there are a few other methods of source control if you are interested.
## Prerequisites
  Aside from Android Studio, you need to install git and have a github account.
  - Github link: https://github.com/
  - Git download: https://git-scm.com/  
  Second, you need to have your project on github. You can do this in Android Studio by going to VCS > Import into Version Control > Share Project on Github. However, it is much better to fork the ftc_app program, as this makes it easier to update the SDK without having to move all of your files. Do this by going to the ftc_app page on github, link [here](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app), then clicking the fork button in the upper right corner. If you already have code, you may need to push it into this new repository.
## Connecting to you repository
  To connect your Android Studio to the github repository, you need to get to the Android Studio welcome menu. Do this by saving your project, then go to File > Close Project. This welcome menu will automatically open.
