## What is Hardware Design?
### The hardware of a robot is the robot's physical composition, with all the different attachments and electronics
#### Mechanical Engineering:
Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies the principles of engineering, physics, and materials science for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.  
For a better performance of the robot, the mechanical design is crucial. The mechanical design of a robot can an decide the accuracy and efficiency during performances. Â

* [Drive Train](https://ftccats.github.io/drivetrain)
* [Attachments]

During the process of building the robot, selections of the materials are crucial to the performance of the robot. Some materials provide benefits that others do not. The following links will take you through the pros and cons of some of the common materials used on the FTC robots:
* [Wheels]
* [Gears vs. Chains]
* [Servos vs. Motors]

#### Electrical Engineering:
  Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics. It is the branch of engineering that deals with how the electronics of a robot. Here is an example of an electrical engineering: If a robot is not wired properly, issues can arise.
