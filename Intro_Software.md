## What is Software's role in FIRST?
Software's main purpose within FIRST is to program it in order to instruct it to move an perform tasks. This is usually done through Java and Android Studio, though alternatives exist. FIRST gives templates for programs & provides tutorials, so don't worry if you don't know much about programming. Aside from that, FIRST strongly encourages use of CAD design, especially PTC Creo. Using CAD supplies three main advantages: firstly the ability to 3D print parts for your robot, secondly the ability to design and simulate items virtually, and thirdly the possiblity of getting awards such as the PTC design award.

We will be using quite a broad definitition of software. It will include programming, source control and CAD design.
