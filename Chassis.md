## Chassis
The chassis of a robot is the overall bare frame of the robot. The chassis supports the drive train as well as teh electronics installed on the robot. How well built the chassis is can affect the durability and reliability of a robot. If the chassis is built too big, then the robot would have a hard time manuveuring around. The chassis would not be able to suppor the robot if it is constructed out of fragile material. Starting off with a simple chassis with four wheels that are ungeared can help you get a feel for what is right for your robot. THis chassis is easy to build and provides strong support for robot. This type of chassis is stable and durable, ensuring that the robot will not randomly break apart.
