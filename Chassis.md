## Chassis
The chassis of a robot is the overall bare frame of the robot. The chassis supports the drive train as well as teh electronics installed on the robot. How well built the chassis is can affect the durability and reliability of a robot. If the chassis is built too big, then the robot would have a hard time manuveuring around.
