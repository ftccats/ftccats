Gracious Professionalism
========================

## Intro to Gracious Professionalism

Gracious Professionalism is one of the most important components of the FTC competition. It is a step above the FLL term: "Core Values".
When a person refers to Gracious Professionalism, it is supposed to help one through not just the FTC competition with teamwork and 
collaboration on robotics projects, but it is also supposed to help people with learning life lessons about how to learn through life and
struggle to accomplish their goals.

## Beyond Gracious Professionalsim

Gracious Professionalism is not just one part of FTC, but also a key part toward making friends and collaborating well with people in
school. Through helping others and learning together through competition, it creates a bond that allows for opportunities.

## First Definition of Gracious Professionalism

"FIRST is more than robots. THe robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what
to expect - of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision with confidence, and with a sense
that they can create their own future." ~ Dean Kamen

## Our Thoughts


"FIRST teaches us a lesson on more than just working on robots. Robotics can get you to learn about robots, but only through Gracious Professionalism can you learn to love." ~ Ethan Hu
