# Core Values of FTC

The FTC competition is not merely just to compete. It is an experience in which all can learn a life lesson from. Through the 
FTC competition, it is expected that all teams display their gracious professionalism and be the best they can be as people. 
Being the best person is what the FTC competition is. The FTC competition is about motivating teammates and helping people learn. 
Through being the best person we can be, we can create the best environment for us all to be able to learn.

This is what Gracious Professionalism is as described by a computer:

~~~~
public class GraciousProfessionalism {
   public static void main(String[] loveLearning) {
      
   }
   public double SportsmanshipQuality(double quality) {
      
      if (quality < 5 && quality > 0) {
         quality = 5.0;
      }
      else {
         quality = 2.0;
      }
   }
}
public class FTCSpirit {
   public boolean hasGraciousProfessionalism {
      GraciousProfessionalism robotics = new GraciousProfessionalism("Core Values");
      return this.robotics > 0;
   }
}
~~~~

What we'd love to do is help other teams learn. When teams are learning, it means that we are learning too. That would show that we can create a good learning environment for everybody in our circles.
