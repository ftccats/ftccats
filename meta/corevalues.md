# Core Values of FIRST

The FIRST program is not merely just to compete with robots, it is a journey in which all can learn a life lesson from. Through the 
FTC competition, display of gracious professionalism and core values is encouraged.
The FIRST program strives to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators, by engaging them in exciting Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. When participants start their journey in this program, they are being prepared for the workplace with life essential skills developed through the collaboration with others.  
Being the best person is what the FTC competition is. The FTC competition is about motivating teammates and helping people learn. 
Through being the best person we can be, we can create the best environment for us all to be able to learn.  
What we'd love to do is help other teams learn. When teams are learning, it means that we are learning too. That would show that we can create a good learning environment for everybody in our circles.
