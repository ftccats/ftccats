### Power Distribution Modules
There are two different types of power distribution modules, or the main thing that distributes the software.
There is the REV one (REV Expansion Hub), and the modern robotics one (Core Power Distribution Module).
The REV one have the wiring ports of motors, sensors, servos, etc. all one the same board, also it has 4 motor ports.
The modern robtics one distributes it to many different other modules.
The other modules includes motor controller, servo controller, device interface, and the legacy module.
The motor controller have 2 motor ports, the servo controller and device interface have a lot.

### General Wiring Tips
* If something is not working, make sure when you configure the robot, you set the correct ports to the correct things.
* Make sure the wires are plugged in correctly and not loose, correctly means the color to itself. As in red to red, black to black, etc. Also, white sometimes goes to yellow.
* Label your wires, label both ends the same thing, preferably what you named it in the program.

If REV Expansion Hub does not have enough ports for your robot, you can connect both of them together!
