# Relic Grabber

### What it does

Our current relic grabber (check the sources link) pushes the relic against the corner or the playing field, then the hook reaches out and grabs the top of the relic. The pushing allows the relic to not move and stay still, which lets the hook grab the relic with the pushing part at the same time. Allowing you to lift it up.
