# Relic Grabber

### What it does

Our current relic grabber (check the sources link) pushes the relic against the corner or the playing field, then the hook reaches out and grabs the top of the relic. The pushing allows the relic to not move and stay still, which lets the hook grab the relic with the pushing part at the same time. Allowing you to lift it up.

### What it includes

Our relic grabber have two servos. one to operate the hook in the relic grabber, and one to move the arm attached to the relic grabber, changing the position so it is low/high enough to grab it.
