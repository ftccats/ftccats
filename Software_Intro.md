## What is Software Engineering?
Software Engineering is the application of mathematics and technology to the design, implementation, and testing of computer programs to optimize their production and support. A robot without software programming is basically a complexly designed lump of wires and building material. With correctly programmed software, a robot can move and do all the task that you require it to. Different software, like PTC can be used to design teh individual components of the robot, making the design of the robot more precise.  
To have a better understanding of software engineering, you can watch the following videos:

In the FTC competition, Android Studio is used to program the robot. Teams use the programming language java to code their robts. FIRST has alreadyt the basic outline of the code done for teams, and all teams have to do is to modify to code to the components of their robot.
