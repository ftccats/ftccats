## What is Software Engineering?
  Software Engineering is the application of mathematics and technology to the design, implementation, and testing of computer programs to optimize their production and support. A robot without software programming is basically a complexly designed lump of wires and building material. With correctly programmed software, a robot can move and do all the task that you require it to. Different software, like PTC can be used to design teh individual components of the robot, making the design of the robot more precise.
