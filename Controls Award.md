###Control award
**Autonomous Objectives:** Our goal for autonomous is to knock down the correct jewel, decipher the pictograph and put the preloaded glyph into the correct spot, get another glyph and put it into another spot, and then park in the safe zone.
**Sensors Used:** Color sensor, IMU (inertial measurement unit), touch sensor, range sensor, these sensors allow more precise movement in autonomous.
**Key Algorithms:** Color sensing, precise movement, distant sensing, PID (Proportional Integral Derivative), these things allow more accuracy and precision.
