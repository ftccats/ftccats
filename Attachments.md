# Attachments to our Robot

### What Attachments do

Attachments are things you add to the [chassis](https://ftccats.github.io/Chassis) to let the robot do more things than just move around.
For example, our relic grabber grabs and holds the relic, the arm lifts the sidebars and the glyphs, the side bars grab the glyphs, and the linear slide extends out so we can drop the relic out side.
